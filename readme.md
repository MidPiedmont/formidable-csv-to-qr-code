# Formidable CSV to QR CODES
This bash script will take a formidable CSV export of entries and create QR codes to view the `Detail Link` view of each entry individually and output to a directory called `qrcodes`.

You can change the variables in the script to suit your needs, I think they're relatively self-explanatory.
